/*
Fifo: pages are placed in queue when loaded, first in queue is flushed on fault.

Not Recently Used: uses the R and M bits (we need to clear 'R' every once in a while).
Like 4 FIFOs, one for -R-M, -R+M, +R-M, +R+M, in that order

Second chance: Like FIFO, but if the first entry has R set, clear its R and move it to the
end of the queue.  Clock is just like this.

Least recently used: have a clock.  Whenever a page is referenced, increment the clock, then
save this value with the page.  Pick the one to swap out by finding the smallest value of
last reference.

Approximated LRU: have 6-bit R field.  Each clock tick we shift them right by 1.
